One very sad and cold day outside, there was one computer science student
stuck inside all day working on an assignment. It had been many days since
 he had seen sun light. Recently, his diet was consisting of only QQs and 
Ginger Root. His body was craving anything with nutritional value so bad that
he had halluciations about vegetables. "Nonsense," the studnt thought, as he
shoved his mouth full of more sesame chicken.
