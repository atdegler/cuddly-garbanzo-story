One very sad and cold day outside, there was one computer science student
stuck inside all day working on an assignment. It had been many days since
 he had seen sun light. Recently, his diet was consisting of only QQs and 
Ginger Root. His body was craving anything with nutritional value so bad that
he had halluciations about vegetables. "Nonsense," the studnt thought, as he
shoved his mouth full of more sesame chicken. 

Suddenly the student was deep in a dream. In the middle of a street there was desk. Sitting at it was Bill Gates. As the student walked up to Mr. Gates he realizes that Mr. Gates was about to interview him. Sure enough he sits down and Mr. Gates starts asking him to code things on a laptop. The student reaches to start coding and realizes all that is on the screen is ginger root vegeteables surrounded what looked like hexadecimal digits.
